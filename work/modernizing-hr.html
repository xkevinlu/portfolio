            In 2015, ADP had a line of HR products geared towards specialists that was difficult to use for employees. To address this, ADP opened an Innovations Lab to reinvent HR.

            For 2018, I was responsible for leading the design of new features and enhancements for the Time experience across Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, and Kiosk.
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-start">DISCOVERY & CONCEPT</h5>
          <p>
            I worked with product managers, developers, and UX researchers across multiple scrum teams to generate insights and create concepts to address customer needs.

          <h5 class="section-start">EXPERIENCE STRATEGY & VISION</h5>
          <p>
            I focused on goals and outcomes of design by sharing prototypes, presentations, and frameworks to help drive decision making.

          <h5 class="section-start">DESIGN EXECUTION & ITERATION</h5>
          <p>
            I delivered wireframes, flows, and prototypes to execute features and supported scrum teams through production. I also worked with data to test, iterate, and refine designs.
          </p>
          <h5 class="section-start">LEADERSHIP</h5>
          <p>
            I frequently presented case studies and processes to senior stakeholders, other teams, or at ADP wide forums. I conducted UX Seminars for designers across ADP.

          <p>
            For an hourly worker, time literally is money. The amount they bring home every pay period is directly related to the number of hours worked. For many workers, recording their hours is an inefficient or manual task. For many companies, getting an accurate record of an employee's hours worked is a cumbersome process as well.

            <h1 class="section-title">Consumerize HR Upfront</h1>
            <p>Our new employee and manager self service (ESS & MSS) was built on a new front end stack, driven by APIs from various legacy back-end time systems. This strategy enabled us to go to market much faster, but also had a tremendous impact on the quality of the experience we could deliver.</p>
            <div class="p-5 text-center">
              <h5>Various back-end systems & APIs</h5>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/modernizing-hr/backend.png">
              <h5>One user-centered, self service application</h5>

            </div>
            <div>

              <h5>DESIGN FOR THE 99%</h5>
              <p>The strategy was to “consumerize HR” with employee and manager self service in mind, creating new mental models where needed, and optimizing for the mass market rather than a niche group of practitioners.</p>
              <p>The goal was to break down product silos, create new universal mental models, and hide the system complexity of various back-end flows. This meant often facing pushback from practitioners, and leaning into our user research to test our hypotheses.</p>

              <h5>EMBEDDED INTO SCRUM AND CENTRALIZED</h5>
              <p>Our team had a hybrid of decentralized vs. centralized organization. Each designer was embedded on a product team with a triad, and also frequently met with the entire design team for standups, design reviews, and discussions to ensure a unified experience. </p>
              <p>I worked closely with the Time product owner and engineers to execute features in the current and upcoming sprint, while concurrently working with other designers and stakeholders to plan future work and ensure system consistency.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Do More than Clock & View Pay</h1>
            <p>
              In its current state, our product was essentially a clock in/out button and (successful) pay stub visualizer. Over 80% of our usage was for the Pay feature.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
              The reality was that employees and managers often had to manage a seperate legacy login to do more complex time workflows, such as requesting a leave of absence or approving a batch of timecards.
            </p>

              Even though these users wanted to switch to the new experience, they were forced to continue working in the older systems to complete their tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally, the question became: How might we enable employees and managers to complete their tasks?

            </figure>
            <p>Many fingers pointed to “feature parity” with legacy systems as a major need, and our PO had pressure to ship features ASAP. Chasing feature parity however wouldn't help us solve user problems any better than today's solution. I reframed the features my PO had planned as benefits for the user, and to think in terms of achieving outcomes. To quote Theodore Levitt, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.”</p>

            <p>
              Finally, we needed to identify the information architecture of how all these different time features would fit together.

          <h6 class="section-start">THE VISION</h6>
          <h1 class="section-title">Plan, Enter, Review</h1>

          <p>To achieve our overarching goal of accurate and efficient time entry, I identified three main phases of the time entry process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Plan - When am I supposed to work?</li>
            <li>Enter - Record the time I worked</li>
            <li>Review - Check and approve the time I entered</li>
          </ol>
          <p>As they say in economics, all models are wrong, but some are useful. This framework allowed us to organize features in the context of the user journey.</p>

          <h6 class="section-start">PLAN</h6>
          <h1 class="section-title">View and Modify Work Schedule</h1>
          <p>I designed a new Employee Schedule and Shift Swap based on a calendar to take advantage of the desktop form factor, that allowed employees to quickly see the hours they are scheduled, any transfers they might have, time off requests pending, and shift swap requests. The mobile experience would default to a week list view.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Take Leave of Absence</h1>
            <p> To eliminate the seam of having to request Leaves from another system, I worked closely with the PO and lead developer of the Leave team to design and coordinate a unified time off experience. Again we aimed to simplify the experience for a non-specialized user or practitioner, so we worked to eliminate system jargon and optimized flows for user journeys.</p>

              <p>I often paired designed / programmed with an engineer throughout the development cycle. Thinking through code helped keep my designs grounded in systems thinking, and had a major influence on how I componentized different elements. It also made me think through the lens of cost benefit of building a certain interaction, such as the calendar popover positioning. </p>

              <p>For detailed animations / interactions, I would sometimes provide small code snippets for the developer as a reference.</p>

              <p>I created vision videos and prototypes to help imagine what could be. This was the case when the UX team wanted to explore what could be possible with voice and chatbot technology.</p>

              <p class="pt-5">For complicated flows like Requesting Time Off, I created high-fidelity prototypes with Sketch + InVision to show both the happy path and the various branched flows.</p>
