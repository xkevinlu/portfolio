          Rethinking HR Time
        </h1>
        <p class="lead">
          In 2015, ADP opened an Innovations Lab to build their next-gen HR software. By 2017, a new intuitive HR experience was launched, but users hated having to switch back to a legacy system to do other tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          I was part of the Innovation Lab's ambitious effort to consumerize HR, unifying 10+ legacy products into a single experience so millions of workers could self-service essential HR tasks.

        <p>
          For 2018, I was responsible for leading the design of new features and enhancements for the Time experience across Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet / Kiosk.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-start">DISCOVERY & CONCEPT</h5>
        <p>
          I worked with product managers, developers, and UX researchers to generate insights and create concepts to address customer needs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-start">EXPERIENCE STRATEGY & VISION</h5>
        <p>
          I focused on goals and outcomes of design by sharing prototypes, presentations, and frameworks to help drive decision making.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-start">DESIGN EXECUTION & ITERATION</h5>
        <p>
          I delivered wireframes, flows, and prototypes to execute features and supported scrum teams through production. I also worked with data to test, iterate, and refine designs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-start">LEADERSHIP</h5>
        <p>
          I frequently presented case studies and processes to senior stakeholders, other teams, or at ADP wide forums. I conducted UX Seminars for designers across ADP.

          The Self Service MVP lacked a lot of self service.

        <p>
          In its current state, our product was essentially a (successful) pay stub visualizer. Over 80% of our usage was for the Pay feature.

          The reality was that employees and managers often had to manage a seperate legacy login to do more complex workflows and HR tasks, such as requesting a leave of absence.

        <!-- <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/modernizing-hr/legacy-etime.png"> -->
        <p>
          These users were hesitant to upgrade because they couldn't do what they needed to do without having to go into another system anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therfore, the first step was to identify what employees and managers needed to do and enable them to do it efficiently, improving the flow of work and ultimately driving adoption.

        <h1 class="section-title">Consumerize HR Upfront</h1>
        <p>Our new employee and manager self service (ESS & MSS) was built on a new front end stack, driven by APIs from various disjointed back-end systems. This strategy enabled us to go to market much faster, but also had a tremendous impact on the quality of the experience we could deliver.</p>

        </div>
        <div>

        <h5>DESIGN FOR THE 99%</h5>
        <p>The strategy was to “consumerize HR” with employee and manager self service in mind, creating new mental models where needed, and optimizing for the mass market rather than a niche group of practitioners.</p>
        <p>The goal was to break down product silos, create new universal mental models, and hide the system complexity of various back-end flows. This meant often facing pushback from practitioners, and leaning into our user research to test our hypotheses.</p>

        <h5>EMBEDDED INTO SCRUM AND CENTRALIZED</h5>
        <p>Our team had a hybrid of decentralized vs. centralized organization. Each designer was embedded on a product team with a triad, and also frequently met with the entire design team for standups, design reviews, and discussions to ensure a unified experience. </p>
        <p>I worked closely with the Time product owner and engineers to execute features in the current and upcoming sprint, while concurrently working with other designers and stakeholders to plan future work and ensure system consistency.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">User Insights</h1>
        <p>Together with a UX researcher, we conducted regular discovery, concept, and usability studies of 5-8 participants, as well as client site visits. Here are some key insights that drove design philosophy:</p>

        <h6>FRAMING THE PROBLEM</h6>
        <h1 class="section-title">"Do" What?</h1>

          <p>Many fingers pointed to “feature parity” with legacy systems as a major need, and our PO had pressure to ship features ASAP. Chasing feature parity however wouldn't help us solve user problems any better than today's solution. I used the Jobs To Be Done model to reframe features as benefits for the user, and to think in terms of achieving outcomes through user task analysis.</p>

            Finally, it was important to get a lay of the land, and understand the high level architecture of where users would go to complete certain tasks.

          <p>I often paired designed / programmed with an engineer throughout the development cycle. Thinking through code helped keep my designs grounded in systems thinking, and had a major influence on how I componentized different elements. It also made me think through the lens of cost benefit of building a certain interaction, such as the calendar popover positioning. </p>

We had a relatively mature design language with many components implemented in code, so it was relatively straightforward to assemble the visual elements.</p>
